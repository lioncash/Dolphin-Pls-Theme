# Pls Theme

A really good theme; I made it in PaintTool SAI instead of MSPaint, so quality was definitely on the table.

### I need this, how do I install it.

1. Place the folders into the Dolphin `User/Themes` directory (or `Sys/Themes` if you can't be arsed to find that).
2. Open Dolphin and go to Config -> Interface
3. Set the theme to one of the three themes
4. Done
